        <p>Hollywood failing to be more inclusive of different identities is not only costing the industry millions of dollars each year, but is also signaling to Black creators who may wish to work in the industry that they are not wanted. Despite these obstacles, they are finding ways to challenge the status quo and gain opportunities for themselves.</p>

<p>The industry is losing out on $10 billion each year due to its lack of diversity, according to a study from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/black-representation-in-film-and-tv-the-challenges-and-impact-of-increasing-diversity#">McKinsey & Co.</a>  that reviewed revenues across the U.S. from global theatrical box office, streaming services, cable, and broadcast. 

    “Fewer Black-led stories get told, and when they are, these projects have been consistently underfunded and undervalued, despite often earning higher relative returns than other properties,” the report outlined. 
    </p>

<p>Hashtags like #OscarsSoWhite and #EmmysSoWhite have raised awareness about not only the underrepresentation in these spaces, but how that impacts funding, getting roles and being <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/actresses-colour-equal-pay-1.5228185"> paid equally to white counterparts</a>. Part of that is based on who is able to get their foot in the door. 
    </p>

<p>Cahlia Walton, a production assistant in New York, is working toward becoming a TV writer and producer. But, she explained how knowing someone in the field was her ticket to getting her current position, an opportunity not many have.</p>

<p>“I went to school for business and did not realize I wanted to work in TV until two years ago,” she said. “I got really lucky because one of my sorority sisters was also a Black woman working in production management.Cahlia expressed that she recognized her privilege in this instance,because Hollywood is a game of connections and who you know. “It’s why it kind of seems to stay as the same white guys that seem to get the roles because they know other white guys,” she continued.

<p>According to the <a href="https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/hollywood-diversity-report-2020/">UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report</a>,white people held 92% of all chair and chief executive positions, with 68% of them being male in 2020. These are the people that make the major decisions when it comes to what shows and movies get greenlit, how they’re funded and more. If the C-suite is not reflective of the industry, any chances of progress will fall flat.
</p>

<p>Jaran Huggings is a senior film and media arts major at Temple University, with a concentration in directing. He recognizes that this space is not reflective of the diversity in the world, but still wants to help the industry move past it’s history of exclusion.</p>

<p>“We've been very much subjected to a whitewashed film/cinema culture, you know, for over the past 100 years,” he said. “So right now, It's kind of the golden age for diversity and inclusion within storytelling in both TV and film. I'm excited because I know what I want to represent on screen and I'm 100% prepared to do that.”</p>

<p>While Huggings and Walton are ready to be the inspiration for future generations of Black filmmakers and screenwriters, their current inspirations are still struggling with having others see their vision.
 </p>

<p>Issa Rae, the creator of the famous dramedy Insecure on HBO, shared in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/issa-rae-insecure-white-characters-viewers-1235027856/">several interviews</a>  that she was advised to introduce white characters into her predominantly Black shows in order to appeal to white audiences. 
    </p>

<p> “There is this pressure for Black writers to talk about the Black experience within a white context. In Season 1, we were briefly encouraged to tell the point of view of the Frieda character [Issa’s white colleague at the nonprofit, played by Lisa Joyce]. Why would we do that?,” Rae told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/arts/television/insecure-final-season-issa-rae.html">New York Times</a>.</p>

<p> The advice she was given is not new, and it shows that production companies don’t believe in the strength of an all Black cast to be successful on its own, outside of the white gaze. Award shows like the Oscars emphasize that sentiment. Since its inception in 1929, only 39 Black actors and actresses have received an Oscar for best actor or actress and none have won for best director. That’s out of the 3000+ awards given out across all the categories. </p>

<p> But, there is work being done to shift the narrative from all levels. The Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema in Brooklyn has a mission of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/nyregion/lights-camera-color-new-film-school-focuses-on-industrys-diversity.html">assisting women and people of color</a> in their pursuit of being in the film industry, for a third of the cost of an average school. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-03-24/hollywood-grass-roots-networks-boost-diversity-film-tv">#StartWith8Hollywood</a>, an organization looking to provide an easier entry way into the industry has already matched over 1,000 people with industry mentors. While this doesn’t translate into employment, initiatives like these are a good start towards rectifying decades worth of exclusion. The standards for content are changing, and there’s a new generation of creators determined to continue that change. Sooner or later, Hollywood will have to adjust to the times, or suffer from holding up an outdated status quo.
